The website is designed to provide users with a comprehensive overview of the school and its courses. It is easy to navigate and provides all the necessary information needed to make an informed decision about attending the school.

It is responsive, meaning it can be viewed on different screen sizes and devices. Users can easily move between the different sections of the website, and watch videos from different lessons (the progress will be saved). 

On the page containing all courses, when a user hovers over an image, a short video about the course will be displayed.
